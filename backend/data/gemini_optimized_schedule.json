    "scheduling_strategy": "Given the extremely limited scope of the provided script (only one scene), the primary strategy is to schedule this single scene efficiently while adhering to the specified constraints as much as possible. Since there's only one scene and one location, location efficiency is inherently maximized. Actor availability is also trivially handled as no actors are involved. Time of day logic is applied directly to the scene. Weather dependencies are noted but not actionable with a single night scene. Crew efficiency is addressed by scheduling the scene on a single day, minimizing the need for extended crew engagement.",
